.NET library for implementing Genesys Web Services clients.

How to include this library into your project
=============================================

This library makes use of a modified fork of the CometD.NET libraries. The solution depends on that project being in the local path.

So please

1. Clone this repository.
2. Clone the [CometD.NET fork](https://github.com/ErnestoGarciaGenesys/CometD.NET) at the same folder level.
